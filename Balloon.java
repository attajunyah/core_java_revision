/*
 * Your task is to design a program that models inflating a spherical balloon. 
 * First the balloon is inflated to have a certain diameter (which is provided as an input). 
 * Then inflate the balloon so that the diameter grows by an inch, and display the amount the volume has grown. 
 * Repeat that step: grow the diameter by another inch and show the growth of the volume. Hint: The volume of a sphere is 
	4/3 Ï€r^3.
